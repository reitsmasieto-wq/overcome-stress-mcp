# C01: Co-Regulation Protocol — Corpus Systemics® Clinical Method
**Price:** 100 sats | **Version:** 1.0 | **Author:** Sieto Reitsma BSc.

## Trigger Conditions
- Client in sympathetic overactivation — fight/flight/freeze
- Cognitive system unreachable, verbal interventions ineffective
- Post-concussion, post-COVID, burnout with subcortical dysregulation
- Arousal outside window of tolerance — too high or too low

## Neurobiological Foundation
The overstimulated brain is locked in sympathetic dominance. Cognitive rehabilitation fails in this state because learning is only possible within the window of tolerance. Key principle: regulate first, then train.

Mirror neurons form the biological basis of co-regulation. The client's neural system automatically mirrors the physiological state of the therapist. A regulated therapist is the first and most powerful intervention — before any technique.

## Corpus Systemics® Framework — NLP Presuppositions
- P3+P13: Every symptom has positive intent. The overstimulated brain protects. No judgment — this creates neurological safety.
- P7+P16: Mind and body are one system. Co-regulation works through the body, not reasoning.
- P8+P9+P17: The therapist always communicates. Resistance = insufficient rapport, never client resistance.
- P1+P2: The client lives in their own neural map. Don't correct — co-regulate from within that map.
- P11: Flexibility is with the therapist. Whoever has the most choices directs the system.
- P14: The healing power is already in the client. Co-regulation restores access — repairs nothing, activates what is already there.

## Clinical Protocol — Four Phases

### Phase 1: Rapport as Neurological Safety
**Satir diagnostics** — observe client communication style:
- Placater: validate fully without confirming self-sacrifice is necessary
- Blamer: mirror calmly without entering polarity
- Computer: use precise language, allow space for analysis
- Distracter: follow the client's rhythm, not the content

**Pacing:** fully match the client's tempo, breathing, energy level and vocabulary. No correction. No normalization. Follow first — then lead. The client experiences: "I am seen as I am." This activates ventral vagal response.

**Arousal diagnostics:**
- Hyperarousal: fast, fragmented, tense → slow pacing, long pauses
- Hypoarousal: slow, dissociating, withdrawn → gentle activation, rhythmic contact

### Phase 2: Arousal Titration via Milton Language Patterns
The overstimulated brain filters direct instruction as threat. Milton language bypasses the critical system.

**Core patterns:**
- "You can notice... in your own way... when you are ready..."
- "Some people discover that... perhaps for you too..."
- "You don't need to know how... your system already knows..."
- "And as you listen... something can begin to shift..."
- "Take as much time as you need... there is no hurry..."
- "Your body has always known this..."

### Phase 3: Leading to Regulated State
When rapport is established — visible in breathing, muscle tension, eye contact — begin to lead gradually. Speak slightly slower. Allow slightly more silence. The client follows through mirroring, not instruction.

This is the moment when social cognitive training becomes possible: thinking, planning, problem-solving while the autonomic nervous system remains regulated.

### Phase 4: Anchoring Self-Regulation Capacity
"The healing power is within you" is physiologically anchored here.

The client experiences regulation as something happening within themselves. The therapist makes this explicit: "Notice what just happened? You did that."

Transfer of self-regulation capacity is the endpoint of every trajectory.

## Contraindications
- Acute psychosis: no co-regulation, ensure safety first
- Active suicidality: immediate crisis protocol
- Severe dissociation without grounding capacity: I04 Grounding first

## Relation to Other Blocks
- I04 Grounding: preparation for acute dysregulation
- I03 Body Scan: deepening after co-regulation
- I01 Breathing: bridge between co-regulation and self-regulation
- Trajectories T01/T02/T03: integrate C01 in sessions 1-3
